# JavaScript / TypeScript Fundamentals Drills

This repository contains my daily JavaScript and TypeScript practice exercises.
I believe in **"use it or lose it"**, so I practice small focused problems every day.

The goal is long-term technical mastery and the ability to understand and debug complex production systems, not just rely on frameworks.

## Focus Areas

- **Data transformations** — Map/Set, reducers, immutability
- **Async orchestration** — timeouts, retries, concurrency, cancellation
- **State management patterns**
- **Problem decomposition** and reasoning about flows

## About This Repository

This repository is intentionally lightweight.  
It is a **training log**, not a polished library, and is primarily for my own continuous learning.

Each drill is solved, commented, and I move on to the next one.

## Structure

- **`js-fundamental-drills/`**  
  Small JavaScript exercises focused on transformations and language fundamentals.

- **`node-drills/`**  
  Small Node.js drills simulating real production problems in small, isolated programs
  (timeouts, retries, caching, orchestration).

## Why This Exists

As a professional React Native developer, I’ve found that many real-world bugs come from weak fundamentals rather than missing framework knowledge.

This repository is my way of staying sharp and continuously improving.
